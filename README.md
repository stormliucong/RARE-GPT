# RARE-GPT: Rare Disease Diagnosis Support using GPT

RARE-GPT is a machine learning model based on the GPT architecture by OpenAI, which provides support for diagnosing rare diseases. With the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning, we aim to provide accurate and timely diagnoses for patients with rare diseases.

## Features

- A GPT-based machine learning model that analyzes patient data to provide accurate diagnoses for rare diseases.
- A GPT-based machine learning model that analyzes patient data to extract phenotype terms and perform other NLP tasks
- A GPT-based machine learning model that analyzes patient data to contruct standardize based phenotypic profiles including phenopacket and GA4GH
- A user-friendly interface that allows patients and healthcare providers to input and analyze patient data.
- Support for a wide range of rare diseases, including both genetic and non-genetic conditions.
- Regular updates and improvements to the machine learning model based on the latest research and clinical data.
