I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: ARX, DCX, FLNA, GPR56, KIF5C, LIS1, RELN, TUBA1A, TUBA8, VLDLR. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
