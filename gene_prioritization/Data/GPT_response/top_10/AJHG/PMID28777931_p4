I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: MECP2, CDKL5, FOXG1, SCN1A, SCN2A, KCNQ2, KCNQ3, PCDH19, STXBP1, SLC2A1. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate assessment.
