I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, you may want to consider testing the following genes: ARID1B, CREBBP, EP300, KMT2A, KMT2D. However, it is important to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional for personalized advice and accurate testing recommendations.
