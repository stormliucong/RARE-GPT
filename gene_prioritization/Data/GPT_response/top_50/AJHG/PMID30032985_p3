I am an AI language model and cannot access real-time databases to provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date list of genes. However, I can suggest some genes that are commonly associated with the phenotypes you mentioned. Please consult a geneticist or use a specialized database for a more comprehensive and accurate list.

Here are some genes that might be relevant to the phenotypes you described:

FBN1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFB3, SKI, SLC2A10, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, COL5A1, COL5A2, COL3A1, PLOD1, FKBP14, BGN, FLNA, ADAMTS2, ADAMTSL2, EFEMP2, LTBP4, MAT2A, MAT2B, CBS, MTHFR, COMT, VDR, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1, SOD2, CAT, GPX1, GPX3, GPX4, GPX5, GPX6, GPX7, GPX8, HFE, HFE2, HAMP, HJV, TFR2

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and may not be accurate. Consult a geneticist or use a specialized database for a more comprehensive and accurate list of genes to test.
