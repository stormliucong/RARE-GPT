AGT, AGTR1, AGTR2, ALAD, APOA5, APOC3, APOE, CACNA1C, CACNA1D, CACNA1S, CALCA, CALR, CASR, CAV1, CAV2, CAV3, CCL2, CD36, CDH1, CDH2, CDH3, CDH4, CDH5, CDH6, CDH7, CDH8, CDH9, CDH10, CDH11, CDH12, CDH13, CDH15, CDH16, CDH17, CDH18, CDH19, CDH20, CDH22, CDH23, CDH24, CDH26, CDKN1A, CDKN1B, CDKN1C, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN2C, CDKN2D, CEL, CETP, CFTR, CHGA, CHGB
