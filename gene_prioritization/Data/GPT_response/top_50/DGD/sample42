I am an AI language model and I cannot provide a specific list of genes to test for a patient based on their phenotype description. However, I can suggest some genes that have been associated with the mentioned phenotypes. Please consult a genetic counselor or a medical professional for a more accurate and personalized list of genes to test.

Here are some genes associated with the mentioned phenotypes:

1. Cleft palate: IRF6, MSX1, TBX22, FGFR1, FGFR2, BMP4, TP63, SATB2, PVRL1, GRHL3
2. Developmental cataract: CRYAA, CRYAB, CRYBA1, CRYBB1, CRYBB2, CRYBB3, CRYGC, CRYGD, CRYGS, GJA8, GJA3, MIP, BFSP2, EPHA2, PITX3
3. Aniridia: PAX6, FOXC1, PITX2, CYP1B1, FOXE3, B3GALTL
4. Bifid uvula: TBX22, IRF6, GRHL3, CHD7, KMT2D, SPECC1L
5. Barrett esophagus: CDKN2A, TP53, SMAD4, RUNX3, CDH1, CDX2, GATA4, GATA6, MUC2, MUC5AC

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and may not cover all possible genes associated with these phenotypes. It is essential to consult a genetic counselor or a medical professional for a more accurate and personalized list of genes to test.
