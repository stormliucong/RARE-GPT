I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotype description provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: ARX, ZEB2, MECP2, MID1, OFD1, GLI3, SHH, CREBBP, EP300, KMT2D. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
