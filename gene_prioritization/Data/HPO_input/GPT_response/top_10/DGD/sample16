I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotype description provided, you may want to consider testing the following genes: AKT2,PIK3R1,PTEN,TCF4,CDKN1C,NSD1,CREBBP,EP300,GNAS,SMAD4. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate assessment.
