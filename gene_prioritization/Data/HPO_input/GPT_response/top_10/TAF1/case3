I am not a geneticist, but some genes that might be relevant to test based on the phenotype description could include: ARID1B, CHD2, DYRK1A, FOXP1, GRIN2B, HNRNPH2, MED13L, PACS1, SETBP1, SYNGAP1. However, it is important to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional for personalized advice.
