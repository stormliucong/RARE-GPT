I am not a geneticist, but I can provide you with a list of genes that might be related to the phenotypes you mentioned. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or a specialist to get a more accurate and personalized list of genes to test. Here is a list of 50 genes that might be related to the phenotypes:

ARX, MECP2, FOXP2, SETD5, KMT2A, TCF4, DYRK1A, STXBP1, KCNQ2, SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN8A, CDKL5, PCDH19, SLC6A1, GABRB3, GABRA1, GABRG2, CHD2, GRIN2B, GRIN2A, SYNGAP1, CACNA1A, CACNA1C, CACNA1E, CACNA1G, CACNA1H, CACNA1I, CACNA2D1, CACNA2D2, CACNA2D3, CACNA2D4, CACNB1, CACNB2, CACNB3, CACNB4, CACNG1, CACNG2, CACNG3, CACNG4, CACNG5, CACNG6, CACNG7, CACNG8, CNTNAP2, NRXN1, NLGN3, NLGN4X, SHANK3, SHANK2

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and may not be accurate for your specific case. It is important to consult with a professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test.
