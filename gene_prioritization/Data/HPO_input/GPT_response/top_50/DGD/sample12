I am an AI language model and not a geneticist, but I can try to provide you with a list of genes that might be related to the mentioned phenotypes. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a geneticist or a specialist in the field for a more accurate and comprehensive list.

Here are 50 genes that might be related to the mentioned phenotypes:

IL2RG, IL7R, JAK3, RAG1, RAG2, ADA, CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, CD3Z, CD247, CD45, CD8A, CD8B, CIITA, CORO1A, DCLRE1C, DOCK8, FAS, FASLG, FOXP3, GATA2, ICOS, IFNGR1, IFNGR2, IL12B, IL12RB1, IL21, IL21R, IL2RA, IL2RB, IL2RG, IL7R, ITK, LCK, LIG4, MHC2TA, NHEJ1, NOD2, PRF1, PRKDC, RFX5, RFXANK, RFXAP, SH2D1A, STAT1, STAT3, STAT5B, STIM1, ZAP70

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and may not be accurate. Consult with a specialist for a more reliable list of genes to test.
