I am an AI language model and cannot provide a definitive list of genes to test for a specific patient. However, I can suggest a list of genes that have been associated with some of the mentioned phenotypes. Please consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized recommendation.

Here is a list of 50 genes that may be relevant to the mentioned phenotypes:

ARX, CDKL5, STXBP1, SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN8A, KCNQ2, KCNQ3, SLC2A1, SLC9A6, MECP2, FOXG1, TCF4, MEF2C, PCDH19, GABRB3, GABRA1, GABRG2, ALDH7A1, PNPO, POLG, PIGA, SIK1, ADSL, SLC25A22, CHD2, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, HCN1, IQSEC2, KCTD7, MAGI2, NEDD4L, PIGT, PLCB1, PRICKLE1, PRICKLE2, QARS, RAB39B, RELN, RHOBTB2, SLC35A2, SPTAN1, SYN1, SYNGAP1, TBC1D24, TBL1XR1, UBE3A, ZEB2

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and should be used as a starting point for further investigation.
