I am an AI language model and not a genetic expert, but I can provide you with a list of genes that may be related to the phenotypes you mentioned. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and comprehensive list.

Here are some genes that may be related to cardiogenic shock and adrenal insufficiency:

NR3C1, CYP11A1, CYP11B1, CYP11B2, CYP17A1, CYP21A2, HSD3B2, HSD17B3, STAR, MC2R, MRAP, NNT, TXNRD2, AAAS, ACTH, POMC, TPH1, TPH2, ADRB1, ADRB2, AGTR1, AGTR2, BDKRB1, BDKRB2, EDN1, EDNRA, EDNRB, NOS3, NPPA, NPPB, NPPC, NPR1, NPR2, NPR3, REN, ACE, ACE2, AGT, AKR1C3, AKR1D1, CACNA1C, CACNA1D, CACNA1S, CACNB2

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and may not be entirely accurate. It is essential to consult with a genetic expert for a more precise list of genes to test.
