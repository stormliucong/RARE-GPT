xxx prompt a. clinical features is The case of a 4-year-old female who presented to pediatric genetic specialists with congenital hypotonia, bilateral conductive hearing loss, hyperextensible joints, and “staring spells.” The individual experienced transient tachypnea postnatally and was admitted to the NICU for 7 days due to respiratory distress. The patient failed her 5-month hearing screening, leading to an evaluation by otolaryngology, which noted bilateral conductive hearing loss. At 10 months, the patient presented with mild hypotonia, hyperextensible joints, and isolated patellar hyperreflexia. She had relative macrocephaly (head circumference in 98th percentile) and frontal bossing. She, however, had started puree and Step 1 foods later than expected. At 16–17 months, she experienced frequent ear infections. She presented at 20 months with developmental delay and continued hypotonia. She experienced a leg length discrepancy and dragged her left foot, refusing to lift it. She required speech and physical therapy. The patient also slept in 3–5 hour stretches and woke frequently. At 22 months, she was experiencing right leg weakness that accompanied her turning her right foot in when walking, toe walking on her right side, and falling a lot. She continued to have macrocephaly with frontal bossing even after her fontanelles closed. At 2 years old, it was noted she had poor dexterity in her fingers, could run but tripped a lot, and continued to turn her foot in and drag it while walking. At this time, she began to have staring spells 1–2 times a week. At 3 years old, she began stuttering while speaking and experiencing unresponsiveness in the middle of conversations. The patient wore orthotics and a hip brace. Her speech development was delayed. Her parents have noticed she fatigues easily for her age and has a low attention span. She also experiences chronic constipation and passes stool two times a week. She has some feeding difficulty due to oropharyngeal dysphagia. She has one café au lait spot on her right buttock.. please return 50 gene.test
