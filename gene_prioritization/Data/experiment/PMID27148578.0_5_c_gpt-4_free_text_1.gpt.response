xxprompt c. clinical features is The patient was a nondysmorphic, appropriately and symmetrically grown male infant born at 35-wk gestational age. He had a prolonged neonatal intensive care unit stay because of persistent oral feeding incoordination requiring gastrostomy tube placement. Cardiac and neurological imagings were within normal limits. The patient was noted to have hypertonic joints, occasional cortical thumbing, and diffusely increased tone. Shortly after birth, the patient had a brief period of all per oral (PO) feeds. However, with an age-appropriate increase in daily feeding volumes, he demonstrated an inability to regulate suck–swallow–breath. e responded well to oral stimulation with increased tongue and jaw movements, as well as active sucking on the pacifier. When the patient was fed, he demonstrated poor oral transit of the liquid bolus and had difficulty coordinating suck and respiration, resulting in a substantial loss of the bolus at the lips.. please return 5 gene.test
