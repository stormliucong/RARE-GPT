xxx prompt a. clinical features is A patient who presented with dysmorphic features, microcephaly, short stature, metaphyseal dysplasia, ID, and CHD. The patient's cardiac findings included an atrial septal defect and restrictive cardiomyopathy. At birth, he had no respiratory effort and thus required supplementation oxygen, and he was noted to be hypotonic. At 2 mo of age he presented with a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, tracheomalacia, and bronchiolitis. During that period, hospitalization and an echocardiogram were performed that noted a moderate-sized atrial septal defect. Over his first year of life he developed progressive enlargement of his right and left atrium with bidirectional flow across his atrial septal defect and increased right ventricular systolic pressures, suggestive of poor compliance of his ventricular myocardium (restrictive physiology). At 15 mo, a diagnostic heart catheterization demonstrated elevated end-diastolic pressures of both ventricles, whereas a cardiac MRI showed that the pericardium was normal. This constellation of findings was diagnostic of RCM. His clinical course is otherwise remarkable for mild dysmorphic features including a prominent nasal root, hypertelorism, mildly dysplastic pinnae, and brachydactyly of his hands and feet. He has significant short stature and microcephaly. His skeletal survey noted rizomelic shortening, mild lumbar posterior vertebral body scalloping, and metaphysical irregularity in bilateral femurs. e is currently 7 years old and in an age-appropriate academic grade, although he had difficulty with speech and behavioral concerns, including oppositional and aggressive behaviors.. please return 5 gene.test
