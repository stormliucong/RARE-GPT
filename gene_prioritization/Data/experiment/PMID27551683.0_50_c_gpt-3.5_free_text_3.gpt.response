In early infancy, the Ponseti method was used to correct the clubfeet with serial casting, followed by bilateral Achilles tenotomy, and corrective shoes with a foot abduction orthosis. It was noted that he had difficulty opening his hands because of flexion contractures of the fingers and was treated with hand splints and occupational therapy that improved his range of motion. The proband was observed to have some mild craniofacial dysmorphic features including a space between the upper teeth (diastema), ankyloglossia, a round face, down-slanted palpebral fissures with ptosis of the left eyelid, a short, upturned nose with a well-formed philtrum, and small, low-set ears with overfolded helices. An ophthalmologic exam revealed farsightedness and astigmatism bilaterally, a genital exam revealed a mild shawl scrotum and bilateral undescended testes. His feet at most recent exam have reduced creases on the plantar surfaces and residual metatarsus adductus. The individual's hands showed a single palmar crease on the right and a transitional crease on the left with mild flexion contractures of the fingers, brachydactyly, and bilateral clinodactyly.. please return 50 gene.test
