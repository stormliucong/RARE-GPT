xxprompt b. clinical features is A 13-year-old female was evaluated for her history of ataxia, severe hearing loss, optic atrophy, and peripheral neuropathy. She developed normally for the first 8–9 mo, sitting and crawling by 6 mo of age and pulling up at 7.5 mo. Hypotonia was noted by 10 mo of age. Infantile spasms occurred at 12 mo of age, with electroencephalography (EEG) indicating modified hypsarrhythmia. Seizures resolved 6–8 wk after treatment with topiramate and pyridoxine, which was added empirically, and have not recurred. EEG results were normal at 5 and 13 yr of age. At the time of the seizures, levels of urine organic acids, ammonia, plasma amino acids, and serum lactate and pyruvate were normal. Development slowed after the onset of seizures. Walking was achieved at age 3 yr, but balance was poor. Hearing impairment became evident at 3 yr of age and auditory neuropathy was diagnosed. Optic neuropathy was diagnosed at 5 yr of age. Electroretinography was normal. Evaluation for additional neuropathy identified peripheral neuropathy in the lower legs and feet. Nerve conduction velocities performed at 10 yr of age indicated mild axonopathy with decreased velocity and reduced amplitude. Examination of the patient at age 13 revealed ataxia, pes cavus, decreased vibratory sensation and proprioception, hyporeflexia, ophthalmoplegia without ptosis, and bilateral optic atrophy. No abnormal pigment was present in the retina. She walks on the outside of the foot, with gait studies showing a mild increased femoral anteversion, and suffers frequent falls as a result of ataxia; she uses a wheelchair for long distances. She has mild intellectual disability, requiring special education services in a self-contained classroom for students with orthopedic impairment. Primary amenorrhea and lack of breast development prompted an endocrine evaluation. Recently, the patient has experienced two viral illnesses that have been associated with episodes of worsening ocular paralysis.. please return 5 gene.test
