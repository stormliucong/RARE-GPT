His examination revealed dysmorphic face including low-set ears and high arched palate. At the same age, two-dimensional echocardiography demonstrated diffuse left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, with normal ejection fraction. An LV outflow tract obstruction was not present on Doppler echocardiographic examination.. please return 5 gene.test
