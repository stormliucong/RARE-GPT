xxx prompt a. clinical features is On examination at 3 day, he had sparse scalp hair and eyebrows, underdeveloped supraorbital ridges, apparently widely spaced eyes with epicanthal folds, a wide and mildly depressed nasal bridge, a broad nasal tip, and retrognathia. His oral findings included a midline notched upper lip, alveolar ridge overgrowth, high palate, extra frenula, a malformed epiglottis with a midline cleft, and a notched tongue tip. His limb findings were remarkable for mild rhizomelic shortening, bilateral postaxial polydactyly with partial cutaneous syndactyly of fingers 4–5, bilateral preaxial polydactyly with partial cutaneous syndactyly of toes 2–3, broadened metatarsals, short fingers and toes, and small nails. Additionally, a patent foramen ovale, breathing difficulties, and hypotonia were noted. He had mild bilateral mixed hearing loss, for which he had tympanostomy tubes and hearing aids placed at the age of 1 yr. At the age of 2 yr, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mildly to moderately small cerebellar vermis, horizontal and thick superior cerebellar peduncles, superior cerebellar dysplasia, and cerebellar tonsil dysplasia, consistent with the molar tooth sign. Also at the age of 2 yr, a gastrostomy tube (G tube) was placed for swallowing difficulty due to moderate pharyngeal phase dysphagia. At the age of 5 yr, a small penis and disproportionate rhizomelic shortening in the upper and lower limbs were noted. for recurrent seizure episodes showed mild excessive background slowing for age; the episodes were described as petit mal or absence seizures possibly of frontotemporal origin. At this time, hypodontia, midline supernumerary tooth, fused teeth, narrow frenulum, a prominent upper lip, recurrent otitis media with effusion, chronic hearing loss likely mixed in nature, crowded oropharynx space (Mallampati type III), and tonsils 2–3+ in size were noted. At 9 yr, mild obstructive sleep apnea was diagnosed because of short stature, an increased body mass index, a small airway, redundant arytenoids, and hypotonia. At the age of 10 yr, he was noted to have a prominent epiglottis, a small larynx, and a bone age of 8–9 yr (mildly delayed). He had global developmental delay with oculomotor apraxia and drew pictures appropriate for a 4 yr old. He had a speech delay with poor volume and articulation.. please return 5 gene.test
