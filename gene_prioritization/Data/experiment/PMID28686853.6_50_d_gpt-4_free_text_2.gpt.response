Brain MRI showed a pineal cyst and area of signal intensity in cerebellum, ventricular size asymmetry with contour abnormality along the left lateral ventricle and associated mild white matter signal abnormality suggesting a prior insult, well-circumscribed focus nonenhancing T2 signal abnormality in the right cerebellar hemisphere, mild thinning of corpus callosum, mild vermian and left cerebellar hemisphere hypoplasia. He had a history of febrile seizures (one episode at 2 years and one at 3 years) and an episode of body stiffening concerning for a seizure at 3.5 years. EEG showed spike and wave discharges over the vertex and he was started on Depakote. Medical history is also significant for a right-sided aortic arch, eustachian tube dysfunction, and hypotonia. He has some abnormal behaviors (biting, hair pulling) and mimicking behaviors, but is typically friendly with new people. Physical exam is significant for slender build with little subcutaneous fat, mildly coarse features, midface retrusion, large appearing irises with inferior scleral reveal, abnormal lateral brows, depressed nasal root, prominent maxilla, widely spaced teeth, open mouth posture, full lips with decreased cupid's bow, fused and broad secondary alveolar ridges, low set attached gingiva, and bilateral fifth finger clinodactyly.. please return 50 gene.test
