xxprompt c. clinical features is From birth on, he presented with truncal hypotonia, spastic tetraparesis, and dystonia. Brain MRI showed marked supra-tentorial cortical atrophy with ventricular dilatation as well as bifrontal white matter abnormalities and delayed myelination. At age 2.5 years, the affected individual was bed- and wheelchair-bound with no head control. He could neither sit unaided nor speak or understand simple orders. He was otherwise fully conscious and alert, and he could smile at times and follow with his eyes. Major swallowing difficulties led to gastrostomy. At the age of 3 years, he developed complex epilepsy treated by oxcarbazepine (Trileptal®), clobazam (Urbanyl®), and topiramate (Epitomax®).
 Electroencephalography at the age of 7 years showed in the awake state, an absence of occipital alpha rhythm, polyrhythmic background activity with diffuse alpha, theta and rare delta rhythms, multifocal spikes and sharp waves, sometimes in bursts or rhythmic sequences, with right posterior predominance. Cardiac ultrasonography, audiological and ophthalmological examination were normal. At the age of 7 years and 9 months, the ventricular dilatation and sub-tentorial cortical atrophy were increased.
