Brain sonography showed mildly enlarged lateral ventricles at the third day of life, which was confirmed by brain MRI performed at 4 weeks showing also periventricular cystic changes. According to sonographic investigations these changes were progressive. EEG performed at the age of 7 days showed neither awake-sleep differentiation nor physiological grapho-elements, background activity was persistently low-voltaged with amplitudes under 15 Î¼V (Figure S3B). Myoclonic twitches were observed during sleep, however without EEG correlate. Otoacoustic emission was pathologic on both sides. Newborn screening did not reveal any abnormalities. A ketogenic diet was started, which resulted in a decrease of lactate concentrations but also lead to a weight loss and worsening of his condition. The child died at the age of 2 months.. please return 50 gene.test
