xxprompt b. clinical features is She showed problems in respiratory adaptation and was ventilated by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for 3 hours. Severe lactic acidosis up to 17mmol/L was observed and further on respiratory decompensation and signs suspicious of epilepsy treated by phenobarbital. EEG at the (chronological) age of 3 weeks was abnormal lacking physiological grapho-elements and sleep-wake differentiation, showing reduced amplitudes (below 20 ÂµV), however on phenobarbital treatment. There was no pattern typical for epilepsy. EEG at the age of 5 months was still pathological without physiological elements, however showing a richer background activity. At the age of 6 months multifocal spikes and sharp waves were noticed. At the age of 3 weeks micro- and macrocystic changes of the parietal brain parenchyma on both sides were noted. Brain MRI showed enlarged lateral ventricles and formation of cysts in the cortex and white matter of the whole cerebral structures. Furthermore, gyration of the cerebral hemispheres was decreased. Echocardiography showed a mild septum hypertrophy but normal ventricular function. The child died
