xxprompt d. clinical features is Hypotonia was noted by 6 months of age. By 9-10 months of age, lack of developmental progress was noted, and the patient was evaluated by a neurologist who diagnosed motor delay. Ophthalmologic evaluation at 10 months disclosed lacrimal duct blockage, but no other abnormalities. At 12 months, occasional exotropia was noted, which became constant by 13 months of age and ptosis developed by 15 months. Tremors were first noted at 10 months of age, and increased spasticity was noted by 1 year. Initial brain MRI without contrast was normal at 11 months of age. Repeat brain MRI with and without contrast, completed at age 1 year 8 months, revealed abnormal bright T2 and FLAIR signal in the posterior half of the midbrain with extension to the quadrigeminal plate. The abnormal signal extended to the posterior portion of the pons, abutting the floor of the 4th ventricle. Small areas of increased T2 and FLAIR signal were seen in both cerebral peduncles at the level of the midbrain. MR spectroscopy showed a normal lactate peak on left basal ganglia at 4 years of age. Multiple other brain MRIs without contrast were normal (2 years 5 months, 4 years, and 11 years of age). Other past medical history includes a horseshoe kidney diagnosed incidentally. She was able to sit at 9 months and cruise at 12 months. She lost these skills slowly over time. She is currently in a wheelchair. She is nonverbal, but engages socially with facial expressions including a social smile. She can fix vision on objects and can follow some simple commands with hands. On the most recent exam, at age 17 years, the patient sits upright in a wheelchair, but has dystonic movements of her trunk. She has microcephaly and mild coarsening of features with thick eyebrows. The anterior hairline extends onto her forehead. She is able to move her head and has normal extraocular movements with intermittent strabismus. She has normal nose, mouth and ears. Chest exam is significant for kyphoscoliosis. Cardiovascular and respiratory exams are normal. Abdomen is not distended, with no hepatosplenomegaly. Her sexual development is Tanner stage V, normal female. Extremities are atrophic and with significant hypertonia, more evident on left side compared to right. Mild contractures are seen in most joints. She has bilateral choreoathetoid movements, which increase with agitation, but she is able to try to grab objects with overshooting.. please return 5 gene.test
