xxx prompt a. clinical features is A 6.5 year old boy with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, profound global delay, early developmental arrest, cortical visual impairment, feeding difficulties and a hyperkinetic movement disorder. The pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. His parents were non-consanguinous, and had no family history of neurological disorders. He presented at 6 weeks of age with prolonged focal motor seizures and reduced visual attentiveness. He initially developed left clonic leg jerks during wakefulness and sleep. This evolved to right or left limb involvement with impaired awareness or bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. His EEG at 2 months showed paroxysmal delta and frequent independent bilateral mid-central parietal spikes and sharp waves (right > left) and occasional right temporal spikes. His seizures initially responded partially to phenobarbital and levetiracetam, but he had seizures every 1 to 6 months. The longest seizure free period was 16 months, between 4 and 6 years. Seizures were often prolonged and/or occurred in cluster. Currently, he has been seizure free 5 months on phenobarbital, levetiracetam and clobazam. He did not tolerate topiramate. His EEG at 4 years revealed a slow dysrhythmic background with multifocal epileptiform discharges. He never progressed past the infantile level; however, there was no definite regression until 4 years 9 months when he was hospitalized for lethargy, irritability and focal motor status epilepticus. Following seizure control, the lethargy and irritability improved, but he could no longer tolerate oral feeds and a G-tube was placed at 6 years. At 6.5 years, he is non-verbal, and unable to sit unsupported. He has reduced visual attentiveness, sluggishly reactive pupils, axial hypotonia, mild limb spasticity and dyskinetic movements of his arms.. please return 5 gene.test
