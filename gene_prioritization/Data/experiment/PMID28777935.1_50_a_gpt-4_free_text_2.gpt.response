However, myoclonic seizures recurred and she also developed atypical absence and rare generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Lamotrigine proved ineffective. Seizures were stopped on Divalproex sodium and ethosuximide and she has been seizure free since 11 years. She has been on Divalproex sodium monotherapy since age 17 years. Her most recent EEG at 14 years revealed a dysrhythmic background and rare sharp waves in the bilateral anterior quadrants. Early development was normal except for language delay noted at 2 years, but with time, global developmental delay became more apparent. Neuropsychological assessment at 11 years confirmed mild to moderate intellectual disability and ADHD. Her ADHD symptoms improved on methylphenidate.
