xxprompt c. clinical features is Hypotonia was noted at birth and he was interned at level I neonatal care on the fourth postnatal day, due to poor sucking, restlessness, and regurgitations. He was diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism and thyroid replacement therapy was started. Between 12 months and 3 years of age, he was hospitalized nine times due to lower respiratory tract infections and reactive airway. A work-up comprising viral serology, complete blood count, lymphocyte subset analysis, serum immunoglobulin levels, and sweat test showed results within the normal range. He had a febrile seizure at the age of 3 years, during a hospital stay due to pneumonia. Neurodevelopmental milestones were significantly delayed; he sat without support at 18 months of age, walked independently at 42 months, used first two-word sentences at 4 years of age, and did not have sphincter control until 6 years of age. He had a happy demeanor during examination, was cooperative, but had short attention span. Physical evaluation indicated thick, bushy hair, abnormal hair patterning with two hair whorls on the frontal hairline, bilateral epicanthus tarsalis, upslanting palpebral fissures, mild malar rash, wide nasal bridge and ridge, broad nasal tip with short columella, smooth and long philtrum, thin vermilion of upper and lower lips, high and narrow palate, pointed chin, bilaterally low-set, posteriorly rotated ears with angulated helices, prominent antihelix stems, underdeveloped superior crura, and hypoplastic lobules. He had doughy, mildly hyperextensible skin, hyperextensibility of the elbow joints and small joints of the hand, small hands with total hand length of 10.5 cm [<3rd centile], bilateral single palmar flexion crease, fifth finger clinodactyly, bilateral pes planus, broad halluces, and dystrophic toenails. Hands and feet were cold due to peripheral vasomotor disturbance with episodic cutis marmorata and redness. He had a 5x5 cm patch of hypertrichosis localized on the lumbar area and a sacral dimple. Neurologic and systemic examinations were unremarkable except mildly wide based gait. Detailed metabolic screening including urine and plasma amino acids, urine organic acids, total and free carnitine, acylcarnitine, and oligosaccharides yielded no evidence of an inborn error of metabolism.. please return 50 gene.test
