xxx prompt a. clinical features is Prenatal scans revealed multiple fetal abnormalities, including cerebellar hypoplasia, shortened corpus callosum, prominent cisterna magna, an echogenic intra-cardiac focus, hypertelorism, postaxial polydactyly on all four limbs, single umbilical artery, and near term onset of growth restriction. At birth, the baby was also found to have a large anterior fontanelle, flat nasal bridge, broad upturned nose, hypoplastic alae nasi, full lips, umbilical hernia, cryptorchidism and hypospadias. The baby was microcephalic at birth. The boy required several days of respiratory support initially, and had recurrent apneic episodes in the first few months of life; consequent investigations revealed tracheobronchomalacia, central apnea and subclinical seizures. On assessment at 2 and 4 months of age, he had global developmental delay, central hypotonia, microcephaly (-2.5 SD) and poor weight gain (-3 SD). His length remained in the normal range (20th centile). Brain MRI showed abnormal cerebellar foliation, lower vermis hypoplasia, large supravermian cyst, mega cisterna magna, abnormal brainstem with loss of normal pontomedullary sulcation, and short corpus callosum with tapering of the posterior body and splenium. Echocardiogram revealed bicuspid aortic valve, patent foramen ovale and patent ductus arteriosus.. please return 5 gene.test
