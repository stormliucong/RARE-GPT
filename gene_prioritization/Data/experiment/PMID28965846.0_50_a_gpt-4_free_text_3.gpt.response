xxx prompt a. clinical features is She started to have poor voice understanding and visual impairment at the age of 13 years old. Ophthalmologic and audiological examinations were performed at 19 years when she arrived in France. A diagnosis of auditory neuropathy has been confirmed due to the association of a deep discrepancy between the hearing defect in tonal and speech audiograms (mild and severe defects respectively), bilateral conserved otoacoustic emissions and bilateral desynchronized Auditory Brainstem Reponses (ABR) at all sound intensity. Ophthalmologic fundus found a bilateral papilledema pallor. Optic coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated a bilateral optic nerves atrophy. Cerebral, eyes and internal canals MRI showed small optic nerves predominating at the left side with heterogeneous signals; without any abnormalities in supra-tentorial regions, posterior fossa nor inner ears (data not shown). Her neurological examination stilled normal at 22 years old. Her visual acuity was very low (2/10 in the right side and 1/10 in the left). Glycaemia, echocardiography, cardiac holter, ECG and electromyogram were normal at the same age.. please return 50 gene.test
