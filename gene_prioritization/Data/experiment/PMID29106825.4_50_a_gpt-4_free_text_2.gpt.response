xxx prompt a. clinical features is There were no neonatal problems until concerns arose from age 13 weeks with visual inattention, variable strabismus, horizontal nystagmus, fisting movements and slowing head growth (0.4th centile). Tone was commented to be “quite good, possibly increased” with some head control and normal reflexes. MRI brain at age 4 months noted marked delay in myelination thought to be an evolving leukodystrophy. Repeat MRI a year later showed generalized atrophy of cerebrum and cerebellum, with generalized reduction of white matter and abnormally deep sulcation but no definite change from the previous MRI and no calcification. Development was delayed globally but there was no regression. At 2 years she was starting to attempt, but could not sustain, a crawling posture, mouthed persistently and had no babble. She had difficulty swallowing semi-solid foods, with gagging. Relatively long tapering fingers, with generally small hands and feet (not oedematous), were noted clinically but she was not facially dysmorphic. She displayed brief episodes, not thought to be epileptic (normal EEG) and never associated with loss of consciousness, of dystonic posturing with extension of her trunk, neck and arms, associated with hyperventilation. She tended to keep her hands clenched at all times. Truncal tone was increased and tendon reflexes were slightly increased. At age 6 she vocalized but still had no words, remains non-verbal but with good hearing and has a happy disposition. She will clap hands when asked. Bruxism, drooling and stereotypic behaviours including hand-flapping, spontaneous paroxysmal laughter and breath-holding are noted features. With support, she can walk with a broad based gait. Problems with gagging on semi-solid food persist. She has no urinary or bowel control. Hip problems arose age 6 with her leg ‘giving way’ with recurrent dislocations. She has had one prolonged generalized seizure age 10 concurrent with urinary tract infection but was afebrile. Later EEG was normal.. please return 50 gene.test
