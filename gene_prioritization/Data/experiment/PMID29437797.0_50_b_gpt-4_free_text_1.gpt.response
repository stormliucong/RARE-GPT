xxprompt b. clinical features is A male patient with mild ID, sensorineural hearing loss, macrocephaly, and progressive gait problems underwent routine molecular diagnostic investigations for copy-number aberrations (on high-resolution Affymetrix SNP-array type 6.0) and de novo or recessive Mendelian causes of developmental delay. Two hours after birth he became cyanotic with marmorated skin, and examination showed marked hypotonia, a heart murmur, unstable blood pressure, and areflexia. He responded to sedation, vasopressors, and intubation and resolved completely within a few days. He has never had any seizures. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy was discovered at 3 mo of age. He had several attacks with normothermic tachypnoea and sweating as an infant. Cerebral MRIs showed nonprogressive findings: His ventricles were large and there were symmetrical atrophic changes in the lentiform nuclei (putamen and globus pallidus) and a thick cranium. A metabolic screen and muscle biopsy were normal. He was hypotonic with developmental delay: walked at age 2.5 years and started talking at age 4.5 years. Vision has been normal but with alternating strabismus. He has a nonprogressive sensorineural hearing impairment accompanied by dysarthria. Cognitive skills were formally addressed to a level of mild ID at age 16, with normal behavior and social skills. On examination at age 24 years he is short, 8 cm below the 2.5th percentile (âˆ’3.7 SD), with a large head (61 cm, +3.1 SD) and mild facial dysmorphism. He also has hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and tapering fingers. He has always been overweight, at age 15 his BMI was 24.6. Neurological assessment at age 5 revealed finger tremor, delayed fine motor skills, slow gait, spasticity, and sensorineural hearing loss. Assessment at age 19 showed that his gait was abnormal with a tendency to scissoring and posturing of the left arm. Formal testing showed asymmetrical spasticity and hyperreflexia more prominent on the left, as well as bilateral Babinski signs. There was also slight rigidity in both arms. motor function has slowly deteriorated. As a teenager he played soccer as a 12th team member, but now he needs a wheelchair to get around.. please return 50 gene.test
