xxprompt c. clinical features is The proband presented to us at the age of 10 yr with end-stage chronic uveitis and progressive sensorineural hearing loss. He had no light perception in both eyes. There was bilateral band keratopathy without any view to the posterior pole. His visual issues were first noted at age 2, where he showed vertical nystagmus, bilateral pupillary membranes, anterior and posterior inflammatory cells, retinal membranes, and optic disc edema. His magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which revealed thickening of the optic chiasm and enhancement affecting the prechiasmatic optic nerves, was consistent with optic neuritis. By age 5, he had lost all vision and his eyes were prephthisical. The patient met his developmental milestones until the age of 2 yr, but has he had developmental delays with regard to language, socialization, and quantitative reasoning. He had displayed slow progression in his learning, which appeared to plateau in the most recent years. There was less delay in the patient's gross motor development, although he was noted to have mild truncal hypotonia and displayed repetitive hand motions. He had unexplained behavioral outbursts. Hearing difficulties began at age 6, and audiograms revealed mild high- to mid-range sensorineural hearing loss. He had lifelong gastrointestinal difficulties, including episodes of chronic diarrhea and constipation.. please return 50 gene.test
