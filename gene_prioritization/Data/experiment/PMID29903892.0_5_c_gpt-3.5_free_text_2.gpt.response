xxprompt c. clinical features is Prenatal ultrasound at 38 wks revealed a highly vascular mass anterior and superior to the left ear measuring 5.3 × 2.7 × 4.5 cm, along with mild cardiomegaly. he exhibited mild acrocyanosis but maintained oxygen saturations of >94% on room air. A 5 × 5 × 4-cm, soft, compressible, subcutaneous lesion was noted in the left temporal area anterior superior to the left external auditory canal, with moderate distortion of left ear architecture but patent ear canal. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR angiography of the head showed a large left temporal soft tissue extradural lesion with avid enhancement, prominent extracranial arterial supply, and large arterial feeders from the superficial temporal and the occipital arteries concerning a high-flow lesion. Radiographic differential diagnoses included a hemangioma, an arteriovenous malformation, or an arteriovenous fistula. Hemodynamic irregularity and a notable focus of plum red discoloration over the vertex of the lesion further supported concerns for a high-flow vascular lesion. Permanent histologic analysis revealed lobular capillary proliferation within dense fibrous stroma with large irregular vessels. Immunohistochemical staining for Glut-1 staining was negative. No evidence of cataracts or nephropathy was noted during hospital stay or any of the postdischarge visits. Sutures were removed on postoperative day 21 with excellent wound healing. Postdischarge evaluation by a neonatologist noted few small hyperpigmented macules on the left calf and Mongolian spots on the buttocks.. please return 5 gene.test
