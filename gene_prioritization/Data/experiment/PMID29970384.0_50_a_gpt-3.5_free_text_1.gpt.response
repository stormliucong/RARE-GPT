xxx prompt a. clinical features is Workup for mitochondrial disorder, including muscle and liver biopsies, was inconclusive. However, the liver biopsy did demonstrate moderate portal, periportal bridging, and centrilobular fibrosis. Transient elevated transaminases were present at age 2–4 yr with no identified cause for the liver disease. Short stature failed to respond to growth hormone therapy. Thrombocytopenia was mild and intermittent between the ages of 2 and 5 yr, but became persistent at age 6 yr. She has never been neutropenic or anemic except for an episode of pancytopenia at age 9 yr with a fever and presumed viral illness. Bone marrow biopsy performed during this illness showed low cellularity (10%, normal for age ∼60%–70%) but no other specific abnormalities. Prior to age 2 yr, she had four episodes of pneumonia. A skeletal survey at age 6 yr demonstrated mild S-shaped scoliosis, irregularity of the vertebral body endplates, metaphyseal irregularity of the femoral necks and the left proximal humerus, irregularity of the bony acetabular roofs and iliac crests, and metaphyseal cupping involving the metacarpals of the hands, later classified as spondylometaphyseal dysplasia—corner fracture type. She developed restrictive lung disease secondary to worsening scoliosis. The patient presented with hematuria at age 4 yr. She was started on hydrochlorothiazide with resolution of urine calcium levels. Learning disabilities were diagnosed in the second grade. t age 14 yr, her height and weight were below the first percentile. A repeat skeletal survey at age 14 yr demonstrated progression of the previously identified metaphyseal abnormalities.. please return 50 gene.test
