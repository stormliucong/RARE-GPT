xxprompt c. clinical features is Patient 2 is a 6-yr-old boy born at 38 wk gestation after a pregnancy noted to have severe polyhydramnios, fetal macrocephaly, and marked decreased fetal movement, particularly of the arms and legs. At birth he had dysmorphic features, bilateral symmetric facial weakness, micrognathia, weak cry, absent gag, and markedly decreased muscle bulk/tone with severe contractures (elbows, wrists, fingers, ankles in flexion, knees extended, hips internally rotated). Bone survey on day of life 1 showed right femur fracture. Neonatal brain MRI was consistent with very severe in utero hypoxic ischemic injury. He developed intractable epilepsy and hydrocephalus requiring shunt placement at 6 mo of age. Follow-up brain MRI at 3.5 yr showed near complete absence of cerebral white matter and cortex with subsequent enlargement of the ventricular system.. please return 5 gene.test
