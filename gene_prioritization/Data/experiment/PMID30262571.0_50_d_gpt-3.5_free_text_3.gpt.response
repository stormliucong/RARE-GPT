xxprompt d. clinical features is We encountered a 28-yr-old male proband who had neurodevelopmental disability and generalized hyperkinetic movements. There were no congenital malformations. He experienced two episodes of transient cyanosis at age 6 wk with spontaneous resolution. Since the age of 3 yr, he has been under regular surveillance of medical experts because of global developmental delay. He was only able to sit on his own at 18 mo and failed to walk unassisted before the age 3 yr. He had motor coordination problems, with both coarse and fine movements being very clumsy. Speech development was profoundly impaired, such that by the age of 5 yr only a few short phrases were expressed. Over time, he was noted to have significant socialization difficulties and other behavioral abnormalities, including negativism, lack of emotional control, and autoaggressive reactions. Neuropsychological assessment at the age of 10 yr yielded a diagnosis of moderate intellectual disability and possible autism spectrum disorder. He started to develop worsening limb coordination and difficulty walking, accompanied by the appearance of dystonic posturing of his left leg and forceful trunk retroflexion. By the age of 15 yr, disabling twisting postures affected the neck, torso, and all four extremities. Additionally, he manifested irregular jerks and abnormal adventitious movements of the arms, more pronounced by intentional action, along with increasing articulation deficits. Neurological evaluation at the age of 16 yr revealed generalized dystonia (retro torticollis, dystonia of the trunk and limbs bilaterally) combined with choreoathetoid movements aggravated by voluntary actions, hyperkinetic dysarthria, myoclonus, and minor ataxic features. Physical examination was unremarkable and documented no gross dysmorphic stigmata. Movement disorder symptoms were irresponsive to trialed medications including levodopa, anticholinergics, tiapride, and botulinum toxin. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was notable for the presence of localized atrophy involving the cerebellum. Neither signs of leukodystrophy nor structural defects were evident in the basal ganglia, white matter, and corpus callosum.. please return 50 gene.test
