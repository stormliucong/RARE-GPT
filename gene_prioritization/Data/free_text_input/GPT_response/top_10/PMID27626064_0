I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, you might consider testing the following genes: MECP2, CDKL5, SCN1A, SCN2A, FOXG1, KCNQ2, STXBP1, PCDH19, SLC2A1, GABRG2. However, it is important to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your specific case.
