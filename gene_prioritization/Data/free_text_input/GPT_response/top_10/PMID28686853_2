I am not a geneticist, but some genes that might be relevant to test based on the phenotype description could include: MECP2, SCN1A, CDKL5, FOXG1, STXBP1, KCNQ2, PCDH19, GABRA1, SLC2A1, SLC9A6. However, it is important to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for this specific case.
