I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, you might consider testing the following genes: ARX, DCX, FLNA, GPR56, KIF5C, LIS1, RELN, TUBA1A, TUBA8, VLDLR. However, it is important to consult with a genetic professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for this specific case.
