I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, you may want to consider testing the following genes: FGFR3, SHOX, NPR2, GHR, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, COL5A2, and FBN1. However, it is important to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your specific case.
