I am not a doctor, but based on the phenotype description provided, I can suggest a list of genes that might be relevant to test. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and testing recommendations. Here are 10 genes that could be potentially related to the described symptoms: ARX, CDKL5, FOXG1, MECP2, MEF2C, SCN1A, SCN2A, SLC9A6, STXBP1, TCF4.
