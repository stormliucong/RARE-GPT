I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, you might consider testing the following genes: FGFR3, MECP2, SHH, SOX9, TBX5, ZEB2, PAX6, CREBBP, EP300, ARX. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a geneticist or a healthcare professional for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
