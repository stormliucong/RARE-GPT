I am not a doctor, but based on the phenotype description provided, some possible genes to test could be: PAX8, FOXE1, NKX2-1, DUOX2, DUOXA2, TG, TPO, SLC26A4, GJB2, GJB6. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional or genetic counselor to determine the most appropriate genes to test for this specific case.
