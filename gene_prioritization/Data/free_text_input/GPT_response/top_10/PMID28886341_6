I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, you may want to consider testing the following genes: NSD1, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, HDAC8, ARID1B, MED12, KMT2A, KMT2D, CREBBP. However, it is important to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for this specific case.
