I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, you may want to consider testing the following genes: ZIC1, ZIC4, CEP290, CC2D2A, TMEM67, AHI1, NPHP1, KIF7, GLI3, OFD1. However, it is important to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate assessment and recommendation.
