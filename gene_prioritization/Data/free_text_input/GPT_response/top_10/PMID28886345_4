I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: ARX, DCX, GPR56, KIF5C, PAX6, TBR2, TUBA1A, TUBB2B, TUBB3, VLDLR. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
