I am not a geneticist, but some genes that might be relevant to test based on the phenotype description could include: MECP2, FOXP1, TCF4, SHANK3, DYRK1A, ADNP, SYNGAP1, CHD8, SCN2A, POGZ. However, it is important to consult with a geneticist or specialist for a more accurate and personalized recommendation.
