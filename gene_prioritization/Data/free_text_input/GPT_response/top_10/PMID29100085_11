I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description, some possible genes to consider testing might include: MECP2, CDKL5, FOXG1, UBE3A, SCN2A, KCNQ2, STXBP1, PCDH19, SLC6A1, SYNGAP1. However, it is important to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate assessment.
