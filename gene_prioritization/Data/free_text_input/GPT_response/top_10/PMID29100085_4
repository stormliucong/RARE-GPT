I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description, you might consider testing the following genes: MECP2, CDKL5, FOXG1, SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN8A, STXBP1, KCNQ2, KCNQ3, PCDH19. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for this specific case.
