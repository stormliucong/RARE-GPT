I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, you may want to consider testing the following genes: MECP2, CDKL5, FOXP1, ADNP, SHANK3, SYNGAP1, TCF4, SCN2A, DYRK1A, POGZ. However, it is important to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate assessment.
