I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description, you might consider testing the following genes: VEGFA, KDR, TEK, GNAQ, GNA11, RASA1, EPHB4, ENG, ACVRL1, SMAD4. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for this specific case.
