I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description, you might consider testing the following genes: ARX, L1CAM, DCX, TUBA1A, TUBB2B, TUBB3, KIF5C, KIF2A, DYNC1H1, RELN. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a geneticist or a specialist in the field to get a more accurate list of genes to test.
