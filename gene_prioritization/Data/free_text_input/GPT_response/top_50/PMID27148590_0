I am an AI language model and cannot perform genetic testing or provide specific gene recommendations. However, I can suggest some genes that have been associated with the phenotypes described in the patient. Please consult with a geneticist or specialist for a more accurate and comprehensive list of genes to test.

Here are some genes that might be relevant to the patient's phenotype:

10. COL11A2
11. SLC26A2
12. COMP
13. MATN3
14. FLNA
15. FBN1
16. TGFBR1
17. TGFBR2
18. SMAD3
