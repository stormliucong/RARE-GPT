I am not a geneticist, but I can suggest some genes that might be relevant to the patient's symptoms. However, it is important to consult with a medical professional or genetic counselor for a more accurate and comprehensive list of genes to test. Here are some genes that might be relevant:

SLC2A1, POLG, RRM2B, TWNK, DGUOK, MPV17, TYMP, TK2, SUCLA2, SUCLG1, OPA1, MFN2, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, VHL, RET, NF1, TSC1, TSC2, PTEN, SDHAF2, TMEM127, MAX, FH, EGLN1, EPAS1, KIF1B, SDHAF1, GDNF, EDN3, EDNRB, SOX10, PHOX2B, ASCL1, RET, GDNF, NRTN, PSPN, GFRA1, GFRA2, GFRA3, GFRA4, NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and should not be considered medical advice. Consult with a medical professional or genetic counselor for personalized recommendations.
