I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, I can suggest a list of genes that might be relevant to test. However, it is important to consult with a geneticist or a healthcare professional for a more accurate and comprehensive list of genes to test. Here is a list of 50 genes that might be relevant:

MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT-ND3, MT-ND4, MT-ND4L, MT-ND5, MT-ND6, MT-CO1, MT-CO2, MT-CO3, MT-ATP6, MT-ATP8, MT-CYB, SURF1, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, NDUFA1, NDUFA2, NDUFA3, NDUFA4, NDUFA5, NDUFA6, NDUFA7, NDUFA8, NDUFA9, NDUFA10, NDUFA11, NDUFA12, NDUFA13, NDUFB1, NDUFB2, NDUFB3, NDUFB4, NDUFB5, NDUFB6, NDUFB7, NDUFB8, NDUFB9, NDUFB10, NDUFB11, NDUFS1, NDUFS2, NDUFS3, NDUFS4, NDUFS5, NDUFS6, NDUFS7, NDUFS8
