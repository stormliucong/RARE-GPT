I am not a geneticist, but I can suggest some genes that might be relevant to the patient's symptoms based on my knowledge. However, it is important to consult with a genetic counselor or a medical professional for a more accurate and comprehensive list of genes to test. Here are some genes that might be relevant:

SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN8A, KCNQ2, KCNQ3, STXBP1, SLC2A1, PCDH19, GABRA1, GABRG2, CHD2, SLC6A1, GRIN2A, HCN1, PRRT2, CACNA1A, CACNA1H, DEPDC5, NPRL2, NPRL3, TSC1, TSC2, UBE3A, MECP2, CDKL5, FOXG1, ARX, SIK1, ST3GAL3, ST3GAL5, ALG13, ALG3, ALG12, DNM1, GNAO1, GABBR2, IQSEC2, SMC1A, SYNGAP1, MEF2C, EHMT1, KMT2A, KMT2D, KMT2C, KDM5C, KDM6A, SETD2, SETBP1, SETD5

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and should be used as a starting point for further investigation. It is important to consult with a genetic counselor or a medical professional for a more accurate and comprehensive list of genes to test.
