I am not a geneticist, but I can suggest some genes that might be relevant to the patient's phenotype based on the information provided. However, it is important to consult with a geneticist or a specialist for a more accurate and comprehensive list of genes to test. Here are some genes that might be relevant:

ATP1A3, CACNA1A, CASK, CDKL5, CHD2, CHRNA4, CHRNA7, CLCN4, CLN3, CLN5, CLN6, CLN8, CNKSR2, COL4A1, CSTB, CTNNB1, DCX, DNM1, DOCK7, DYNC1H1, EEF1A2, EHMT1, FGF12, FOXG1, GABRA1, GABRB3, GABRG2, GNAO1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, HCN1, KCNQ2, KCNQ3, KCTD7, KIF1BP, KIF5C, MBD5, MECP2, MEF2C, NEDD4L, NRXN1, PCDH19, PIGA, PLCB1, PNKP, POLG, PRRT2, SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN8A, SETBP1, SLC2A1, SLC6A1, SLC9A6, SMC1A, STXBP1, SYN1, SYNGAP1, TCF4, TSC1, TSC2, UBE3A, ZEB2

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and should be used as a starting point for further investigation. Consultation with a geneticist or specialist is highly recommended.
