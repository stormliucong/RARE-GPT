I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, I can suggest a list of genes that might be relevant to the patient's condition. However, it is important to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and comprehensive analysis.

FBN1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFB3, SKI, COL5A1, COL5A2, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL11A1, COL11A2, COL9A1, COL9A2, COL9A3, COL2A1, COL10A1, COL27A1, SLC2A10, ADAMTS2, ADAMTS10, ADAMTS17, ADAMTSL2, ADAMTSL4, B3GAT3, B4GALT7, CHST14, DSE, D4ST1, FKBP14, FLNA, GORAB, LTBP4, MATN3, MYH11, MYLK, NOTCH1, PLOD1, PLOD2, PLOD3, PRKG1, SLC39A13, SLC39A8, SLC39A14, SLC39A5, SLC39A7, SLC39A12
