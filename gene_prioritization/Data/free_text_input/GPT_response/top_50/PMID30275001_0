I am not a geneticist, but I can suggest some genes that might be relevant to the patient's symptoms. However, it is important to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and comprehensive list of genes to test. Some genes that might be relevant include: ARX, MECP2, CDKL5, FOXG1, UBE3A, SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN8A, STXBP1, KCNQ2, KCNQ3, PCDH19, GABRA1, GABRB3, GABRG2, SLC2A1, SLC6A1, SLC9A6, TCF4, MEF2C, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, CACNA1A, CACNB4, ATP1A2, ATP1A3, CACNA1C, CACNA1D, CACNA1E, CACNA1F, CACNA1G, CACNA1H, CACNA1I, CACNA1S, CACNA2D1, CACNA2D2, CACNA2D3, CACNA2D4, CACNB1, CACNB2, CACNB3, CACNB4, CACNG1, CACNG2, CACNG3, CACNG4, CACNG5, CACNG6, CACNG7, CACNG8. 

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and should be used as a starting point for further investigation. It is important to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and comprehensive list of genes to test.
