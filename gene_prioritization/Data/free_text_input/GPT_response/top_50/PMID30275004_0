I am not a geneticist, but I can suggest some genes that might be relevant to the patient's symptoms. You should consult with a geneticist or a specialist for a more accurate and comprehensive list. Here are some genes that might be related to the patient's phenotype:

MECP2, CDKL5, FOXG1, UBE3A, SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN8A, SLC6A1, SLC9A6, STXBP1, TCF4, ADNP, ASXL3, CHD2, CHD8, CNTNAP2, CTCF, DDX3X, DYRK1A, EHMT1, GABRB3, GRIN2B, HIVEP2, KATNAL2, KDM5B, KMT2A, KMT2E, MBD5, MED13L, MEF2C, MYT1L, NAA15, NRXN1, PAX6, POGZ, PPP2R5D, PTCHD1, PURA, RAI1, SETBP1, SETD2, SHANK3, SLC6A8, SMC1A, SMC3, SYNGAP1, TBR1, TRIP12, ZMYND11

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and should not be considered as medical advice. Consult with a geneticist or specialist for a more accurate list of genes to test.
