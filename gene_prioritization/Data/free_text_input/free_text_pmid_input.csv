MRI brain at age 4 months noted marked delay in myelination thought to be an evolving leukodystrophy. Repeat MRI a year later showed generalized atrophy of cerebrum and cerebellum, with generalized reduction of white matter and abnormally deep sulcation but no definite change from the previous MRI and no calcification. Development was delayed globally but there was no regression. At 2 years she was starting to attempt, but could not sustain, a crawling posture, mouthed persistently and had no babble. She had difficulty swallowing semi-solid foods, with gagging. Relatively long tapering fingers, with generally small hands and feet (not oedematous), were noted clinically but she was not facially dysmorphic. She displayed brief episodes, not thought to be epileptic (normal EEG) and never associated with loss of consciousness, of dystonic posturing with extension of her trunk, neck and arms, associated with hyperventilation.

The patient's cardiac findings included an atrial septal defect and restrictive cardiomyopathy. At birth, he had no respiratory effort and thus required supplementation oxygen, and he was noted to be hypotonic. At 2 mo of age he presented with a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, tracheomalacia, and bronchiolitis. During that period, hospitalization and an echocardiogram were performed that noted a moderate-sized atrial septal defect. Over his first year of life he developed progressive enlargement of his right and left atrium with bidirectional flow across his atrial septal defect and increased right ventricular systolic pressures, suggestive of poor compliance of his ventricular myocardium (restrictive physiology). At 15 mo, a diagnostic heart catheterization demonstrated elevated end-diastolic pressures of both ventricles, whereas a cardiac MRI showed that the pericardium was normal.

Between the ages of 2 and 3 yr, she had recurrent oral thrush. That same year she was also evaluated by allergy/immunology for 4 mo of daily urticaria. At age 4, she was referred to dermatology for dystrophic nails of the right foot and right thumb. She was diagnosed with onychomycosis which was not responsive to griseofulvin or topical therapies. The patient was noted to have abnormal movements of the upper extremities at school that were concerning for seizure activity.",AIRE,0
PMID29437797,"A male patient with mild ID, sensorineural hearing loss, macrocephaly, and progressive gait problems underwent routine molecular diagnostic investigations for copy-number aberrations (on high-resolution Affymetrix SNP-array type 6.0) and de novo or recessive Mendelian causes of developmental delay. Two hours after birth he became cyanotic with marmorated skin, and examination showed marked hypotonia, a heart murmur, unstable blood pressure, and areflexia. He responded to sedation, vasopressors, and intubation and resolved completely within a few days. He has never had any seizures. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy was discovered at 3 mo of age. He had several attacks with normothermic tachypnoea and sweating as an infant. Cerebral MRIs showed nonprogressive findings: His ventricles were large and there were symmetrical atrophic changes in the lentiform nuclei (putamen and globus pallidus) and a thick cranium. A metabolic screen and muscle biopsy were normal. He was hypotonic with developmental delay: walked at age 2.5 years and started talking at age 4.5 years. Vision has been normal but with alternating strabismus. He has a nonprogressive sensorineural hearing impairment accompanied by dysarthria. Cognitive skills were formally addressed to a level of mild ID at age 16, with normal behavior and social skills. On examination at age 24 years he is short, 8 cm below the 2.5th percentile (−3.7 SD), with a large head (61 cm, +3.1 SD) and mild facial dysmorphism. He also has hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and tapering fingers. He has always been overweight, at age 15 his BMI was 24.6. Neurological assessment at age 5 revealed finger tremor, delayed fine motor skills, slow gait, spasticity, and sensorineural hearing loss. Assessment at age 19 showed that his gait was abnormal with a tendency to scissoring and posturing of the left arm. Formal testing showed asymmetrical spasticity and hyperreflexia more prominent on the left, as well as bilateral Babinski signs. There was also slight rigidity in both arms. motor function has slowly deteriorated. As a teenager he played soccer as a 12th team member, but now he needs a wheelchair to get around.",AQP4,0
PMID29444904,"Tonic seizures began at 2 wk of life, characterized by symmetric tonic arm flexion or extension, lasting ∼30–60 sec, averaging 10 per day. At age 7 mo, he developed infantile spasms. After starting oxcarbazepine at 7 mo, the electroencephalogram (EEG) background deteriorated significantly, coincident with the onset of infantile spasms. Currently, seizures are generalized tonic and focal seizures with alteration in awareness. Development has never progressed beyond a 1-mo-old level; the patient occasionally smiles and regards and exhibits profound hypotonia, intellectual disability, and cortical vision impairment. Head circumference, length, and weight have remained normal. His medical and surgical history is also notable for G-tube dependence, chronic lung disease, and Nissen fundoplication.",CDKL5,0
PMID29472286,"The proband presented to us at the age of 10 yr with end-stage chronic uveitis and progressive sensorineural hearing loss. He had no light perception in both eyes. There was bilateral band keratopathy without any view to the posterior pole. His visual issues were first noted at age 2, where he showed vertical nystagmus, bilateral pupillary membranes, anterior and posterior inflammatory cells, retinal membranes, and optic disc edema. His magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which revealed thickening of the optic chiasm and enhancement affecting the prechiasmatic optic nerves, was consistent with optic neuritis. By age 5, he had lost all vision and his eyes were prephthisical. The patient met his developmental milestones until the age of 2 yr, but has he had developmental delays with regard to language, socialization, and quantitative reasoning. He had displayed slow progression in his learning, which appeared to plateau in the most recent years. There was less delay in the patient's gross motor development, although he was noted to have mild truncal hypotonia and displayed repetitive hand motions. He had unexplained behavioral outbursts. Hearing difficulties began at age 6, and audiograms revealed mild high- to mid-range sensorineural hearing loss. He had lifelong gastrointestinal difficulties, including episodes of chronic diarrhea and constipation.",CAPN5,0

PMID29695406,"Ultrasound obtained at 20 wk of gestation showed bowed femurs and right tibia, increased nuchal thickness (6.2 mm), and female external genitalia. No intracranial abnormalities were identified. Amniocentesis was performed at 21 wk of gestation. She demonstrated respiratory distress at birth, requiring immediate intubation and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. She additionally demonstrated a Veau 2 cleft palate, mild retrognathia, and hypertelorism. MRI of the head (protocoled to study the skull base, sinonasal, and facial regions) demonstrated craniofacial defects including cleft hard palate, leftward deviation of nasal septum, hypoplastic mandible and maxilla, and 45° vertical angulation of the skull base. No intracranial abnormalities were noted. Skeletal X-ray survey revealed angulated left femoral shaft, hypoplastic pubic bones, and absent ossification of the right talus.

A 5 × 5 × 4-cm, soft, compressible, subcutaneous lesion was noted in the left temporal area anterior superior to the left external auditory canal, with moderate distortion of left ear architecture but patent ear canal. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR angiography of the head showed a large left temporal soft tissue extradural lesion with avid enhancement, prominent extracranial arterial supply, and large arterial feeders from the superficial temporal and the occipital arteries concerning a high-flow lesion. Radiographic differential diagnoses included a hemangioma, an arteriovenous malformation, or an arteriovenous fistula. Hemodynamic irregularity and a notable focus of plum red discoloration over the vertex of the lesion further supported concerns for a high-flow vascular lesion. Permanent histologic analysis revealed lobular capillary proliferation within dense fibrous stroma with large irregular vessels. Immunohistochemical staining for Glut-1 staining was negative. No evidence of cataracts or nephropathy was noted during hospital stay or any of the postdischarge visits. Sutures were removed on postoperative day 21 with excellent wound healing. Postdischarge evaluation by a neonatologist noted few small hyperpigmented macules on the left calf and Mongolian spots on the buttocks.",MYH9,0
PMID29970384,"Workup for mitochondrial disorder, including muscle and liver biopsies, was inconclusive. However, the liver biopsy did demonstrate moderate portal, periportal bridging, and centrilobular fibrosis. Transient elevated transaminases were present at age 2–4 yr with no identified cause for the liver disease. Short stature failed to respond to growth hormone therapy. Thrombocytopenia was mild and intermittent between the ages of 2 and 5 yr, but became persistent at age 6 yr. She has never been neutropenic or anemic except for an episode of pancytopenia at age 9 yr with a fever and presumed viral illness. Bone marrow biopsy performed during this illness showed low cellularity (10%, normal for age ∼60%–70%) but no other specific abnormalities. Prior to age 2 yr, she had four episodes of pneumonia. A skeletal survey at age 6 yr demonstrated mild S-shaped scoliosis, irregularity of the vertebral body endplates, metaphyseal irregularity of the femoral necks and the left proximal humerus, irregularity of the bony acetabular roofs and iliac crests, and metaphyseal cupping involving the metacarpals of the hands, later classified as spondylometaphyseal dysplasia—corner fracture type. She developed restrictive lung disease secondary to worsening scoliosis. The patient presented with hematuria at age 4 yr. She was started on hydrochlorothiazide with resolution of urine calcium levels. Learning disabilities were diagnosed in the second grade. t age 14 yr, her height and weight were below the first percentile.

PMID30262571,"We encountered a 28-yr-old male proband who had neurodevelopmental disability and generalized hyperkinetic movements. There were no congenital malformations. He experienced two episodes of transient cyanosis at age 6 wk with spontaneous resolution. Since the age of 3 yr, he has been under regular surveillance of medical experts because of global developmental delay. He was only able to sit on his own at 18 mo and failed to walk unassisted before the age 3 yr. He had motor coordination problems, with both coarse and fine movements being very clumsy. Speech development was profoundly impaired, such that by the age of 5 yr only a few short phrases were expressed. Over time, he was noted to have significant socialization difficulties and other behavioral abnormalities, including negativism, lack of emotional control, and autoaggressive reactions. Neuropsychological assessment at the age of 10 yr yielded a diagnosis of moderate intellectual disability and possible autism spectrum disorder. He started to develop worsening limb coordination and difficulty walking, accompanied by the appearance of dystonic posturing of his left leg and forceful trunk retroflexion. By the age of 15 yr, disabling twisting postures affected the neck, torso, and all four extremities. Additionally, he manifested irregular jerks and abnormal adventitious movements of the arms, more pronounced by intentional action, along with increasing articulation deficits. Neurological evaluation at the age of 16 yr revealed generalized dystonia (retro torticollis, dystonia of the trunk and limbs bilaterally) combined with choreoathetoid movements aggravated by voluntary actions, hyperkinetic dysarthria, myoclonus, and minor ataxic features. Physical examination was unremarkable and documented no gross dysmorphic stigmata. Movement disorder symptoms were irresponsive to trialed medications including levodopa, anticholinergics, tiapride, and botulinum toxin. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was notable for the presence of localized atrophy involving the cerebellum. Neither signs of leukodystrophy nor structural defects were evident in the basal ganglia, white matter, and corpus callosum.",CAMK4,0
