I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: GDNF, RET, SOX10, EDNRB, EDN3, PAX3, MITF, SLC45A2, TYR, TYRP1. However, it is important to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional for accurate gene testing recommendations.
