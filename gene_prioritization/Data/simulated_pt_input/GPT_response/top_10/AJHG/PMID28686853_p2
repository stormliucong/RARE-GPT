I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotype description provided, you may want to consider testing the following genes: TBX3, TBX5, PAX2, PAX6, SMN1, SMN2, PKD1, PKD2, CPT1A, and IL2RG. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your specific case.
