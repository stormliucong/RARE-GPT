I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotypes you provided, here are some genes that might be relevant to test: TP53, RB1, MYOD1, MYCN, FOXO1, PAX3, PAX7, ALK, CDKN2A, MDM2. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
