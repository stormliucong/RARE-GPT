I am not a doctor or a geneticist, but based on the phenotypes you provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: COL1A1, COL1A2, FGFR2, FGFR3, LRP5, PTH1R, RUNX2, SOST, TNFRSF11B, WNT1. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a healthcare professional or genetic counselor to get accurate information and guidance.
