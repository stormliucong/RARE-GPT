I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, you may want to consider testing the following genes: NRXN3, TP63, NOTCH2, COL1A1, COL1A2, PAX3, SOX9, FGFR2, FGFR3, SLC6A8. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your specific case.
