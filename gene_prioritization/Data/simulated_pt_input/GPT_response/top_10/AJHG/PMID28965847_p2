I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotypic description provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: PTCH1, TP53, SMARCB1, TSC1, TSC2, NF1, NF2, COL3A1, FBN1, PTPN11. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
