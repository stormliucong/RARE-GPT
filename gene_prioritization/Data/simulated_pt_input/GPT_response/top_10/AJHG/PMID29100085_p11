I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotype description, you may want to consider testing the following genes: GNB5, RAI1, KCNQ2, FOXH1, NKX2-5, GATA4, TBX5, GATA6, CD55, ADGRG6. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
