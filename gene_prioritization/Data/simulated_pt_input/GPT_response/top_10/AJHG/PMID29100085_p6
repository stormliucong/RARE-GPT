I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotype description, you may want to consider testing the following genes: EDA, EDAR, EDARADD, WNT10A, GJA1, LMNA, PLCD1, KRT14, KRT16, KRT17. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
