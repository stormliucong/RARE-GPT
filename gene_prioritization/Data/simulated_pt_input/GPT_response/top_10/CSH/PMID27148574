I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: COL2A1, FGFR2, FGFR3, GJA1, PAX3, SOX9, TBX5, TP63, RUNX2, SLC26A2. However, it is important to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional for accurate guidance on genetic testing.
