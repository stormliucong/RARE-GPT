I am not a geneticist, but based on the symptoms you provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: MECP2, FOXP2, GJB2, SLC26A4, PCDH15, CDH23, OTOF, MYO7A, USH1C, USH2A. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
