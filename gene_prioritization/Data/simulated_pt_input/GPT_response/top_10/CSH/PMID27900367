I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: FGFR2, TWIST1, MSX2, CD4, SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN8A, KCNQ2, KCNQ3, SLC6A8. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for this specific case.
