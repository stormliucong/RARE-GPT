I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotype description provided, you may want to consider testing the following genes: HOXD13, GDF5, BMPR1B, NOG, FGF8, FGFR1, FGFR2, SHH, GLI3, TP63. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your specific case.
