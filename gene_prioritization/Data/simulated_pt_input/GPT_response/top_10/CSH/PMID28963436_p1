I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotypes you provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: NOTCH1, JAG1, TBX1, GATA4, NKX2-5, PAX3, COL2A1, SOX9, SLC22A5, FBN1. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
