I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: FMR1, MECP2, SHANK3, TSC1, TSC2, PTEN, UBE3A, SLC6A8, NLGN3, NLGN4X. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
