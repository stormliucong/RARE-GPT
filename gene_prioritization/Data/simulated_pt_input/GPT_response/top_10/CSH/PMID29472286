I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotypes you provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: FGFR2, NOTCH1, GJA1, TBX5, GDF5, COL2A1, ACVR1, BMPR1A, SMAD3, SMAD4. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate assessment.
