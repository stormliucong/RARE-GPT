I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotype description provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, SHH, GLI3, TP63, GDF5, BMPR1B, NOG, FGF8. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
