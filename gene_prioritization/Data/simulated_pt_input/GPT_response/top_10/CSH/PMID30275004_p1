I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotype description, you may want to consider testing the following genes: FGFR3, GDF5, IGFALS, GJA1, NOTCH1, PAX1, TBX6, HOXD13, SHOX, and GDF6. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your specific case.
