I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotypes you provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: FGFR3, COL2A1, IGHM, CPT1A, TBX5, FOXP1, GDF5, F7, STAT3, TSHR. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate assessment.
