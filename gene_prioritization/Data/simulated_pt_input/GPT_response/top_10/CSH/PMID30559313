I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotypes you provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: PKU, ALDH7A1, TBX5, GDF5, CYP7A1, KCNT1, TP53, BMPR1A, SMAD4, NOTCH1. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate assessment.
