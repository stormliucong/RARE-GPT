I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotype description provided, you may consider testing the following genes: TBX6, NOTCH3, FGFR3, SOX9, PAX3, MITF, SNAI2, EDN3, EDNRB, and GDNF. However, it is essential to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your specific case.
