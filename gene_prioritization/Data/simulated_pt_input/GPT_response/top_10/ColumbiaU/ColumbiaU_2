I am not a doctor, but based on the phenotype description provided, here are 10 possible genes that might be relevant to test: COL4A5, PKD1, PKD2, FBN1, SMAD4, ENG, ACVRL1, NOTCH1, GATA4, TBX5. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a healthcare professional or genetic counselor to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your specific case.
