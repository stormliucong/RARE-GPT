I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotypic description provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: COL2A1, FGFR3, PAX3, SOX9, TRPV4, ALX4, BMPR1B, GDF5, PITX1, TBX4. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate assessment.
