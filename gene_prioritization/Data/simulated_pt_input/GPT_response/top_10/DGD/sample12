I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotypes you provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: APOE, CBS, COL3A1, FBN1, GATA6, KCNQ1, MTHFR, PAX3, TBX1, TGFB2. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a geneticist or a genetic counselor for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
