I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotypes you provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: COL2A1, FBN1, ACTA2, SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFB3, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SKI, SLC2A2. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate assessment.
