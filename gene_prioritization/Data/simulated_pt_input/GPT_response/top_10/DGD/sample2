I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotype description provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: GFAP, CSF2RA, SLC12A1, OTOF, MYOC, TNFSF11, IGFALS, MSX1, PRODH, ALPL. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
