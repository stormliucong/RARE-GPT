I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: RUNX2, TBX5, TP63, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, TWIST1, GJA1, COL11A1, COL11A2. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a geneticist or a genetic counselor for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
