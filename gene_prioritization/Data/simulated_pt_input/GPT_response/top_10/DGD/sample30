I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotype description provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test:

1. ATP7B (copper accumulation in liver)
2. HR (Atrichia)
3. COL5A1 (Knee joint hypermobility)
4. COL5A2 (Knee joint hypermobility)
5. COL3A1 (Knee joint hypermobility)
6. TNXB (Knee joint hypermobility)
7. FBN1 (Knee joint hypermobility)
8. SLC39A4 (Bracket epiphyses of the thumb)
9. TRPV3 (Patchy sclerosis of the distal phalanx of the 4th toe)
10. WNT10A (Patchy sclerosis of the distal phalanx of the 4th toe)
