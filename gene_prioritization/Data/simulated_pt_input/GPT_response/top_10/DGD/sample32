I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotype description provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: TP53, PTEN, RB1, NF1, NF2, BRCA1, BRCA2, RET, ATM, TSC1. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
