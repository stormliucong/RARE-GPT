I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotypes you provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: FOXC2, SOX18, PROX1, GATA4, TBX5, NKX2-5, NOTCH1, BMPR1A, ACVR1, GDF5. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
