I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, you may want to consider testing the following genes: LBR, LMNA, CACNA1A, PRKCG, SCN1A, GJA1, COL2A1, PAX3, SOX9, TBX5. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your specific case.
