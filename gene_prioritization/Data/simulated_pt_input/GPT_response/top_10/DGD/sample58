I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotypes you provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: PAX3, SOX10, EDN3, EDNRB, RET, B3GAT3, CHST14, DSE, FKBP10, SLC39A13. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
