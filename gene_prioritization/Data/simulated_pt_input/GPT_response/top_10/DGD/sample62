I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotype description, you may want to consider testing the following genes: FLG, CFTR, FSHR, SCN1A, ABO, IL2RA, DMD, ATP7A, CACNA1S, KCNQ2. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
