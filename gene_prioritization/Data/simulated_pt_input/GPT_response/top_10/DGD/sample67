I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotypes you provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: AR, SRD5A2, WT1, DHCR7, HOXD13, BMP4, GJA1, TBX4, TBX5, TP63. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for accurate information and guidance.
