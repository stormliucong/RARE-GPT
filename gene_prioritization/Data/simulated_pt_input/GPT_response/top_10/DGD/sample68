I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: ELANE, CYBB, GATA2, HAX1, LYST, WAS, FOXP3, IL2RG, JAK3, RAG1. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
