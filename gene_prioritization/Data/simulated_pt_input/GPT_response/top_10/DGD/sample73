I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotypes you provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: PAX6, CHD7, SOX2, OTX2, SHH, SALL4, MID1, FREM2, FRAS1, GRIP1. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate assessment.
