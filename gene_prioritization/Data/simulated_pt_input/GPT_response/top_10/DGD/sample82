I am not a geneticist, but some genes that might be relevant to the described phenotype could include: FBN1, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, COL5A2, PLOD1, TNXB, SLC39A13, B4GALT7. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your specific situation.
