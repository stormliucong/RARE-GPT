I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotypes you provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: COL1A1, COL1A2, FBN1, PTPN11, NF1, TSC1, TSC2, GATA1, GJB2, TP63. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your specific situation.
