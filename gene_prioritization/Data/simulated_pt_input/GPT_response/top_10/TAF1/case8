I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotypes you provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: FGFR3, GDF5, SOX9, RUNX2, TBX15, COL2A1, COL11A1, COL11A2, PAX3, and SHOX. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a geneticist or a genetic counselor for a more accurate and personalized assessment.
