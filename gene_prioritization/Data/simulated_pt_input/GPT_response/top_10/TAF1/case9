I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotypes you provided, here are 10 genes that might be relevant to test: NF1, TP53, PTEN, TSC1, TSC2, APC, VHL, RET, RB1, BRCA1. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your specific case.
