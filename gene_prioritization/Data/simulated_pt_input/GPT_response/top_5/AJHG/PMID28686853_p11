It is difficult to pinpoint specific genes without more information about the patient's family history and the specific conditions they are experiencing. However, based on the provided phenotype description, here are five genes that could potentially be involved:

SLC52A3, GBA, COL1A1, FANCA, CFTR

Please note that this is not an exhaustive list and further investigation is needed to determine the most appropriate genes to test for this patient. It is recommended to consult with a genetic counselor or specialist for a more accurate assessment.
