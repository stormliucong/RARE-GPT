I am not a genetic expert, but based on the phenotype description provided, you may want to consider testing the following genes: COL2A1, NOTCH1, GATA6, NKX2-5, and MYH7. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your specific case.
