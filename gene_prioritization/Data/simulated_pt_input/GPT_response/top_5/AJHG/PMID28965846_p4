Papilledema and pallor can be caused by various genetic and non-genetic factors. Here are five genes that may be associated with these phenotypes:

1. PAX2 (renal coloboma syndrome)
2. FOXC1 (Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome)
3. PITX2 (Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome)
4. COL4A1 (autosomal dominant porencephaly)
5. NF1 (neurofibromatosis type 1)

Please note that this list is not exhaustive, and it is essential to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional for personalized advice.
