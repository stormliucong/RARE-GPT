I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotypes you provided, you might consider testing the following genes: FGFR3, COL2A1, PAX1, TBX5, FOXP3. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your specific situation.
