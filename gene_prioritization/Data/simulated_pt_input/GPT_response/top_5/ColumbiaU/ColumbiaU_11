I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, you may want to consider testing the following genes: FLNB, GDF5, NOG, BMPR1B, and SOX9. However, it is essential to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your specific case.
