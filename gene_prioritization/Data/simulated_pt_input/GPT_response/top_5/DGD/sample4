I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, you may want to consider testing the following genes: FGFR3, COL2A1, COL11A1, COL11A2, SOX9. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your specific case.
