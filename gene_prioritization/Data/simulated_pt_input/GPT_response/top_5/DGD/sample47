I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, you might consider testing the following genes: TBX5, GLI3, NKX2-5, GJA1, and NOTCH1. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your specific case.
