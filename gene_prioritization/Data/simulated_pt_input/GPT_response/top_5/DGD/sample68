I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, you may want to consider testing the following genes: ELANE, GFI1, HAX1, WAS, and LYST. However, it is important to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your specific situation.
