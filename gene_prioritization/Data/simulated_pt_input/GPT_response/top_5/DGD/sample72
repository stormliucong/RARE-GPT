It is difficult to pinpoint the exact genes responsible for this specific combination of phenotypes without more information. However, based on the phenotypes described, I can suggest a list of genes that may be related to some of the individual conditions:

1. FGFR1 (related to Neoplasm of the nose)
2. COL3A1 (related to Fetal intraventricular hemorrhage)
3. PROP1 (related to Anterior pituitary agenesis)
4. WDR62 (related to Bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria)
5. ELN (related to Anetoderma)

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and should be used as a starting point for further investigation. It is recommended to consult with a genetic counselor or specialist for a more accurate assessment.
