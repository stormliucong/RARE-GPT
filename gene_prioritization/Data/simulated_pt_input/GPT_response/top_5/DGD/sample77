I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, you may want to consider testing the following genes: TBX5, GATA4, NKX2-5, JAG1, NOTCH1. However, it is important to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional for personalized advice and accurate interpretation of genetic testing results.
