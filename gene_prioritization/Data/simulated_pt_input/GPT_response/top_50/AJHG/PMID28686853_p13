I am not a geneticist, but I can suggest some genes that might be related to the phenotypes you mentioned. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and comprehensive list of genes to test. Here are some genes that might be relevant:

ATP1A3, FOXP2, CACNA1A, SETX, SLC6A8, OPHN1, GRIN2A, UBE3A, MECP2, CDKL5, FMR1, TCF4, PQBP1, ARX, SLC9A6, KCNQ2, KCNQ3, SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN8A, PCDH19, STXBP1, SPTAN1, GABRG2, GABRA1, GABRB3, CHRNA4, CHRNA7, CHRNB2, KCNT1, KCNA2, KCNA1, KCNJ10, KCNJ11, KCNJ2, KCNJ6, KCNJ3, KCNJ4, KCNJ5, KCNJ9, KCNJ16, KCNJ18, KCNJ1, KCNJ15, KCNJ12, KCNJ14, KCNJ8, KCNJ13

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and may not include all relevant genes for the phenotypes described. Consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate list of genes to test.
