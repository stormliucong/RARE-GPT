I am an AI language model and cannot access real-time databases to provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information. However, I can suggest some genes that have been associated with polymicrogyria in the past. Please consult a geneticist or use a specialized database like OMIM or GeneReviews for a more comprehensive and accurate list.

Here are some genes that have been associated with polymicrogyria:

ADGRG1, COL18A1, EOMES, FKRP, GPR56, KIF5C, OCLN, PAX6, RAB18, RAB3GAP1, RAB3GAP2, RTTN, SRPX2, TUBA1A, TUBA8, TUBB2B, TUBB3, TUBG1, WDR62, NDE1, NHEJ1, PAFAH1B1, PI4KA, POMGNT1, POMT1, POMT2, RAB18, RELN, SRPX2, TBR2, TUBA1A, TUBB2A, TUBB2B, TUBB3, TUBG1, VLDLR, WDR62, ZIC1, ZIC4, ARFGEF2, ARX, COL4A1, COL4A2, EMX2, FLNA, FMN2, GPR56, KIF2A, KIF5C, LAMC3, MCPH1, NDE1, NHEJ1, PAFAH1B1, PI4KA, POMGNT1, POMT1, POMT2, RAB18, RELN, SRPX2, TBR2, TUBA1A, TUBB2A, TUBB2B, TUBB3, TUBG1, VLDLR, WDR62, ZIC1, ZIC4.

Please note that this list may not be exhaustive or up-to-date, and it is essential to consult a geneticist or use a specialized database for the most accurate information.
