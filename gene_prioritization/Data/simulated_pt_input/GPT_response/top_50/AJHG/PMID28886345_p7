I am an AI language model and not a genetic expert, but I can provide you with a list of genes that might be related to the phenotypes you mentioned. However, I cannot guarantee the accuracy or relevance of these genes. It is important to consult with a genetic expert or conduct thorough research before proceeding with any genetic testing.

Here is a list of 50 genes that might be related to the phenotypes you mentioned:

ABCA4, BEST1, CACNA1A, CDKN2A, CFH, COL2A1, COL4A1, COL4A2, COL9A1, COL9A2, COL9A3, COL11A1, COL11A2, CRB1, CRX, ELOVL4, FZD4, GJA1, GJA8, GUCY2D, IMPG2, KCNJ10, KCNQ2, KCNQ3, KCNQ5, LAMA1, LAMB2, LAMC1, LRP5, MERTK, MYOC, NDP, NR2E3, OPA1, OPA3, OPTN, PAX6, PRPH2, RDH12, RHO, RLBP1, RP1, RP2, RP9, RPE65, RS1, SCN1A, SCN2A, SLC4A4, TSPAN12

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and may not be entirely accurate. It is essential to consult with a genetic expert or conduct thorough research before proceeding with any genetic testing.
