I am an AI language model and cannot provide a real-time analysis of genetic data. However, I can suggest a list of genes that have been associated with peripheral neuropathy and dyschromatopsia. Please consult a genetic counselor or specialist for a more accurate and personalized assessment.

Here is a list of 50 genes that may be relevant to test:

AARS, AIFM1, ATL1, BAG3, BSCL2, C10orf2, C12orf65, CNTNAP1, COX6A1, DCTN1, DHTKD1, DNAJB2, DNMT1, DYNC1H1, EGR2, FAM134B, FGD4, FIG4, GAN, GARS, GDAP1, GJB1, HARS, HINT1, HSPB1, HSPB8, IGHMBP2, KIF1A, KIF5A, LITAF, LMNA, LRSAM1, MED25, MFN2, MPZ, MTMR2, NDRG1, NEFL, NGF, NTRK1, PDK3, PRPS1, PRX, RAB7A, REEP1, SBF2, SH3TC2, SLC12A6, SPTLC1, TRPV4

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and may not cover all possible genes related to the mentioned phenotypes. It is essential to consult a professional for accurate genetic testing and interpretation.
