I am not a geneticist, but I can provide a list of genes that might be related to the phenotypes you mentioned. However, it is important to consult with a genetic counselor or a medical professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for a specific patient. Here is a list of 50 genes that might be relevant:

ATM, APTX, SETX, SLC2A1, SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN8A, KCNQ2, KCNQ3, GABRA1, GABRG2, GABRB3, CHRNA4, CHRNA7, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN1, CACNA1A, CACNA1H, CACNB4, SLC6A1, SLC6A8, SLC9A6, SLC25A22, SLC35A2, STXBP1, STX1B, SYN1, SYNGAP1, ARX, CDKL5, MECP2, FOXG1, TCF4, ZEB2, EHMT1, MBD5, KMT2A, KMT2C, KMT2D, KDM5C, KDM6A, KANSL1, ANKRD11, SATB2, ADNP, CHD2, CHD8, DYRK1A, POGZ

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and should not be considered as medical advice. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate genetic testing for a specific patient.
