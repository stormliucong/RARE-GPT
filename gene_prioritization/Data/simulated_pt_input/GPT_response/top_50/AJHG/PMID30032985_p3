I am an AI language model and cannot access real-time databases to provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information. However, I can suggest some genes that are commonly associated with the phenotypes you mentioned. Please consult a geneticist or use a specialized database like OMIM or ClinVar for a more comprehensive and accurate list.

Here are some genes that might be relevant to the phenotypes you described:
