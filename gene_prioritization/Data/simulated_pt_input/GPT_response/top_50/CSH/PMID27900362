I am not a geneticist, but I can provide a list of genes that might be related to some of the phenotypes you mentioned. However, I cannot guarantee that these genes are the most relevant or that they cover all the phenotypes. It is important to consult with a geneticist or a specialist for a more accurate and comprehensive analysis. Here is a list of 50 genes that might be related to some of the phenotypes:

ABCA12, ACTA1, ADAMTS2, AGA, ALDH18A1, ALMS1, ANTXR2, APOE, AR, BBS1, BBS10, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS9, BRAF, BRCA1, BRCA2, CACNA1A, CACNA1F, CACNA1S, CDH3, CDH23, CDKN1C, CFTR, CHD7, CHM, CHRNA1, CHRND, CHRNE, CHST6, CLCN1, CLCNKB, CLIP2, COL11A1, COL11A2, COL17A1, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL2A1, COL3A1, COL4A1, COL4A2, COL4A3, COL4A4, COL4A5, COL5A1, COL5A2

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and may not cover all the phenotypes you mentioned. It is important to consult with a geneticist or a specialist for a more accurate and comprehensive analysis.
