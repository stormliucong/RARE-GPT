I am an AI language model and cannot provide a definitive list of genes to test for a specific patient. However, based on the phenotype description provided, I can suggest a list of genes that have been associated with similar symptoms in the literature. Please consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional for a more accurate and personalized recommendation.
