I am an AI language model and I cannot access databases to provide you with a specific list of genes. However, I can suggest that you consult resources like OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), ClinVar, or the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) to find genes associated with abnormal kidney localization. You can also consult a genetic counselor or specialist for personalized advice.
