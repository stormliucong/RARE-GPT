I am an AI language model and do not have the capability to perform a real-time analysis of genetic data. However, I can provide you with a list of genes that are commonly associated with sterol metabolism and coagulation pathways, which may be relevant to the phenotype you described. Please consult with a geneticist or a specialist in the field for a more accurate and comprehensive list of genes to test.

Here is a list of 50 genes that may be relevant to the phenotype you described:

CYP27A1, CYP7B1, CYP46A1, CYP51A1, HSD3B7, HSD17B4, SC5D, LBR, DHCR7, DHCR24, EBP, ABCG5, ABCG8, NPC1, NPC2, APOE, APOB, LDLR, PCSK9, LIPA, LCAT, ABCA1, CETP, PLTP, APOA1, APOA5, APOC3, APOC2, LPL, GPIHBP1, ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4, ANGPTL8, F2, F5, F7, F8, F9, F10, F11, F12, F13A1, F13B, PROC, PROS1, PROZ, SERPINC1, SERPIND1, SERPINF2

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and may not be entirely accurate for the specific phenotype you described. It is important to consult with a geneticist or a specialist in the field for a more accurate and comprehensive list of genes to test.
