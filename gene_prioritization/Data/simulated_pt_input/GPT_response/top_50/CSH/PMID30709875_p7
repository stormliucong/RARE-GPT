I am an AI language model and cannot access real-time databases to provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date list of genes. However, I can suggest some genes that have been associated with the mentioned phenotypes in the past. Please consult with a genetic counselor or a specialist for a more accurate and personalized list of genes to test.
