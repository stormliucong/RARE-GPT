I am an AI language model and not a geneticist, but I can provide you with a list of genes that have been associated with the phenotypes you mentioned. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or a specialist in genetics to get a more accurate and personalized list of genes to test.

Here is a list of 50 genes that have been associated with microcephaly, global developmental delay, eczema, and hypertonia:

ASPM, WDR62, MCPH1, CDK5RAP2, CENPJ, STIL, CEP135, CEP152, ZNF335, PHC1, CDK6, NDE1, SASS6, MFSD2A, ANKLE2, CIT, KIF14, NCAPD2, NCAPD3, NCAPH, NUP37, RTTN, CEP63, CEP90, CEP120, CEP295, CEP350, CEP43, CEP170B, CEP162, CEP128, CEP164, CEP89, CEP97, CEP104, CEP131, CEP135B, CEP192, CEP250, CEP290, CEP72, CEP85, CEP170, CEP112, CEP57, CEP57L1, CEP41, CEP44, CEP78, CEP83

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and may not be accurate for your specific case. It is important to consult with a professional to determine the most appropriate genes to test for your patient.
