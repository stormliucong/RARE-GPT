I am an AI language model and cannot provide specific medical advice or recommendations. It is important to consult with a medical professional or genetic counselor to determine the appropriate genes to test for a specific patient. However, I can provide a list of genes that may be associated with some of the mentioned phenotypes. This list is not exhaustive and should not be considered as medical advice.
