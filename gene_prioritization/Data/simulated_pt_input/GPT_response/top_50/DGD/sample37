I am an AI language model and cannot access databases to provide a specific list of genes. However, I can suggest some genes that are commonly associated with disorders of sex development (DSD) in individuals with a 46,XY karyotype. These include:

SRY, AR, NR5A1, WT1, SOX9, DHH, MAP3K1, ATRX, DAX1, WNT4, SF1, DMRT1, DMRT3, GATA4, LHX9, FGF9, FGFR2, RSPO1, VANGL2, ZFPM2, CBX2, AMH, AMHR2, INSL3, RXFP2, HSD17A3, HSD3B2, SRD5A2, CYP17A1, CYP11A1, CYP19A1, POR, STAR, AKR1C2, AKR1C4, MAMLD1, DHCR7, DHCR24, SC5D, LBR, EBP, CHD7, WDR11, KISS1R, KISS1, TAC3, TACR3

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and may not cover all possible genes associated with the phenotype you described. It is essential to consult with a genetic counselor or medical professional for accurate and personalized genetic testing recommendations.
