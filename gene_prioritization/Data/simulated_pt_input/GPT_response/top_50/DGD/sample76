I am not a geneticist, but based on the phenotype description provided, I can suggest a list of genes that might be relevant to the patient's condition. However, it is important to consult with a geneticist or a healthcare professional for a more accurate and comprehensive analysis. Here is a list of 50 genes that might be relevant:

FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, SHOX, GHR, IGF1, IGF1R, PROP1, POU1F1, LHX3, LHX4, HESX1, SOX2, SOX3, OTX2, BMP4, FGF8, PROKR2, PROK2, WDR11, KAL1, ANOS1, CHD7, FGF17, GLI2, GLI3, GNAS, GPR161, HHIP, IHH, KIF7, KISS1R, KISS1, MKKS, MKS1, NEK1, NPHP1, NPHP3, NPHP4, OFD1, PKD1, PKD2, RPGRIP1L, TMEM67, TTC8, TULP1, WDPCP, ZNF423

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and should be used as a starting point for further investigation. It is crucial to consult with a geneticist or a healthcare professional for a more accurate and comprehensive analysis.
