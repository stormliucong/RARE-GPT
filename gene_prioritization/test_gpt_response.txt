As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time data or the ability to perform genetic testing. However, I can suggest a list of genes associated with the given phenotype based on the knowledge available up to my last update in September 2021. Please note that this list is not exhaustive, and genetic testing should be carried out by a qualified healthcare professional or geneticist. Here is a comma-separated list of possible genes to test:

1. SCN1A
2. CDKL5
3. STXBP1
4. SCN2A
5. ARX
6. SLC2A1
7. KCNQ2
8. FOXG1
9. MECP2
10. SLC9A6
11. GRIN2A
12. GRIN2B
13. SPTAN1
14. ARID1B
15. PCDH19
16. TSC1
17. TSC2
18. STX1B
19. DEPDC5
20. KCNQ3
21. UBE3A
22. GABRB3
23. SYNGAP1
24. GRIN1
25. MEF2C
26. NRXN1
27. PIGA
28. RHOBTB2
29. KMT2A
30. FOXG1
31. SATB2
32. TCF4
33. DYNC1H1
34. EHMT1
35. SHANK3
36. CHD2
37. ADNP
38. MED13L
39. HIVEP2
40. CACNA1A
41. WDR45
42. GRIN2D
43. GABRA1
44. GABRB1
45. GABRG2
46. DNM1
47. PRRT2
48. SLC6A1
49. HNRNPU
50. KCNT1

Again, it is essential to consult with a geneticist or medical professional for accurate genetic testing and interpretation of results.
